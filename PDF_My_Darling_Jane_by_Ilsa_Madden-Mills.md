Overview
Wall Street Journal bestselling author Ilsa Madden-Mills returns with a sexy he-falls-first sports romance about a quarterback and his frenemy-matchmaker. On an ordinary day, Jane Darling wouldnâ€™t be caught dead in a sports bar wearing a toga with angel wings. But sheâ€™s desperate to launch her matchmaking business to secure her young daughterâ€™s future. Her mission: to attract new clients at any cost. Her Cupid outfit catches the eye of New Yorkâ€™s beloved star quarterback, Jasper Jannich. She and Jasper have always clashed, but when a pushy admirer goes too far, he steps in as an unexpected knight in shining armor. He offers a tantalizing proposal: to be Cupidâ€™s Arrowâ€™s premier client. Reluctantly, Jane agrees, aware of the business potential despite her reservations about Jasper and his playboy reputation. As she sets him up on date after date, it grows clear that Janeâ€™s the only woman he wants. She is his goal, his endgame. Sheâ€™s not not interestedâ€¦but her heart has been burned before. To get anywhere, theyâ€™ll need courage and faith, not just sizzling chemistry. Heâ€™s ready to make the pass. Is his darling ready to catch it?
