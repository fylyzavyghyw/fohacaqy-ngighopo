Overview
Discover the Science Behind the Art of Tarot Reading What happens inside your brain when you look at a tarot card? How do you attribute significance to symbols? In this book, Siddharth Ramakrishnan, PhD, answers these questions and more as he explores the neuroscience behind intuition and proves that tarot readers arenâ€™t just making up their results. Siddharth unveils the fascinating dance between your body and brain that occurs while delivering or receiving a reading. Learn how this unconscious synergy allows you to process tarot imagery, attach personal meaning, and elicit emotional responses, laying the groundwork for prediction. Filled with dozens of journal exercises and full-color images, this book makes it easy to understand what intuition is scientifically and how to enhance it for more accurate readings from both sides of the table. Includes a foreword by Mary K. Greer, author of Mary K. Greerâ€™s 21 Ways to Read a Tarot Card
