The Hole: A Novel by Hye-young Pyun Misery meets The Vegetarian in this bestseller from Korea, named a 2017 Top 10 Thriller to Read This Summer by Time , a psychological thriller about loneliness and the dark truths we try to bury. In this tense, gripping novel by a star of Korean literature, Oghi has woken from a coma after causing a devastating car accident that took his wife&amp;#039;s life and left him paralyzed and badly disfigured. His caretaker is his mother-in-law, a widow grieving the loss of her only child. Oghi is neglected and left alone in his bed. His world shrinks to the room he lies in and his memories of his troubled relationship with his wife, a sensitive, intelligent woman who found all of her life goals thwarted except for one: cultivating the garden in front of their house. But soon Oghi notices his mother-in-law in the abandoned garden, uprooting what his wife had worked so hard to plant and obsessively digging larger and larger holes. When asked, she answers only that she is finishing what her daughter started. A bestseller in Korea, The Hole is a superbly crafted and deeply unnerving novel about the horrors of isolation and neglect in all of its banal and brutal forms. As Oghi desperately searches for a way to escape, he discovers the difficult truth about his wife and the toll their life together took on her.

        As the adults continue telling stories into the night, it clear that something about the telling of these tales is charging them with an adolescent energy (the act of storytelling is also a reoccurring theme in King&#039;s work).

        The seeming urgency of the plot distracts the reader from considering potentially interesting facts about the people who inhabit Pyun&#039;s fictional world. This isn&#039;t a spoiler, because I was warned of as much myself beforehand and still plowed through the book like a happy idiot. Either way, The Hole is a highlyÂ

        Black Hole by Bucky Sinister - Goodreads
        I&#039;ve not crushed a book in the way I did Bucky Sinister&#039;s novel Black Hole. Finished it in 3 hours. I found it immediately accessible and the contrasting philosophies currently tearing San Francisco apart are laid open in clear-eyed prose driven by a washed-up no-shit narrator. The forces at work are very real in this scienceÂ
